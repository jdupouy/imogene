# Welcome to imogene

**imogene** is an Open Source **Rapid Application Development Studio** for Data Collection Information Systems.

Through an [Android client](http://www.android.com/) and a synchronization server, **imogene** offers the ability to quickly deploy a mobile information system. Thanks to its advanced features, **imogene** particularly fits for **surveillance systems**, where data needs not only to be collected but also to be regularly updated.

**imogene** is specifically designed for **data managers** who do not have advanced development skills but who need to quickly generate modern and efficient information systems. Because all functionalities implementation are provided through the studio, **imogene** users just need to focus on the data model creation to have their **applications automatically generated**.

**imogene** is basicaly a set of [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) plugin. It takes advantage of the code already developed in renowned existing open source projects like [Spring](http://www.springsource.org/), [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/), [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) or [Google Web tool Kit](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/).

The generated Information Systems include the following functionalities:

## Data collection:
* The data collection/consultation in mobile situations (create/search/update)
* The ability to collect data in connected or disconnected mode
* The data storage in a central relational database
* The automatic data synchronization between the applications running in connected/disconnected mode and the central database
* The collection/consultation/analysis of the data from anywhere via a Web interface.
* The collection, transmission and storage of binary data (photo, sound, video, etc)
* The use of bar code (including [QR code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code/))
* The acquisition of GPS coordinates

## User Notification:
The ability to automatically send to users alerts or messages (SMS, Email or pop-up windows displayed in the web interface) when specific events occur in the system (alert a user when a given form is created, when x forms with a field having a given value are entered in the system, etc).

## User privilege management:
The ability to manage user privileges based on users and roles associations.

## Internationalization:
The ability to provide internationalized user interfaces.

## Interoperability:
The ability to communicate with existing Information Systems. This interoperability is based on web services that enable communication between applications.

## Remote update:
The IS applications are based on technologies and follow development standards that enable a remote update of the deployed applications.
